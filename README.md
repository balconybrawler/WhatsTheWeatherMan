# WhatsTheWeatherMan
a simple weather app made in customtkinter, a practice run using api to make weather calls and a clean looking interface.


 chances are the api which is on a trial period will be expired and will not work. So you will need to create an account at weatherapi.com it should be free and open the api file plug your api key and the rest should work just fine.

some small bugs left to be ironed out but for now that was a nice practice run on making a weather app in customtkinter.

definitely a barebones production.

future releases will be using kivymd
